# BodyOS
Coming soon/eventually/?
Time management that keeps track of what you like and need to do to keep all of the various aspects of you healthy- your physical body, your athletic build/body building, your musical skill, just any skill at all.
Eventually we'll add a Body Knowledge Base and ChatGPT (or something) help bot to help be a friend/peer counselor/diagnostician and give you ideas to talk with your therapist or doctor about. Maybe "Chat with your body" powered by AI.
